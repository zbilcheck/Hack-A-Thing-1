# Hack-A-Thing-1

##### We created a basic react website where one can click a button with each of our names, and a modified picture of our group member Urie, with a little identifiable gimmick, appears on the page when each individual group member's name is clicked.  Once clicked again, the image along with the little joke disappears.

##### You can view our website as coded at https://zbilcheck.github.io/Hack-A-Thing-1/
